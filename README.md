## FAQ

**Now, my fav, FAQ!**

#### Can I modify his to fit my needs?

Yeah! why of-course, that is what this whole thing is even for, for you to try, tinker and learn.

#### Can I host this, if I can how?

Yes, you can! with my favourite Apache Container, XAMPP! Since I have explained it 20 times, I'm not kidding, we can skip the explanation because you know the drill.

So! Here is a [download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to the sever, XAMPP (ofcourse)! And if you are struggling about you can start hosting with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) (by MainlyWebStuff).
